# Greetings, to all living things
Alor here, I like me and I think that everyone should remember that you are you and others are others, please don't hate anyone, or anything, or yourself. If you hate someone, then you should try to change your relationship with them into a good one!
If you want to something to change, then create the conditions to do so by changing yourself! I hope that you found this helpful, leave a comment if so!
