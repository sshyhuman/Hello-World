I think it's the 2nd repository
Alor here, I like me and I think that everyone should remember that you are you and others are others, please don't hate anyone, or anything, if you think that only humans can think for themselves then remember your primitive instincts, as well as the primitive instincts of others, what they were evolved to do on this planet. 
If you want to something to change, then create the conditions to do so by changing yourself! I hope that you found this helpful, leave a comment if so!
